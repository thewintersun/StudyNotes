**1、时间常有，时间在于优先。**

There's always time. Time is priorites. 



**2、时间总会有的：每天只计划 4～5 小时真正的工作。**

"Only plan for 4-5 hours of real work per day."   Days always fill up. 



**3、当你在状态时，就多干点；不然就好好休息：有时候会连着几天不是工作状态，有时在工作状态时却又能天天忙活 12 小时，这都很正常的。**

"It's normal to have days where you just can't work and days where you'll work 12 hours straight."  Work more when you're in the zone. Relax when you're not. 



**4、重视你的时间，并使其值得重视：你的时间值 1000 美元/小时，你得动起来。**

"Your time is $1000/hour, and you need to act accordingly."  ==Respect your time and make it respected.==



**5、不要多任务，这只会消耗注意力；保持专注，一心一用。**

Stop multi-tasking. It merely kills your focus. 



**6、养成工作习惯，并持之以恒，你的身体会适应的。**

==Set up a work routine and stick to it.== Your body will adapt. 



**7、在有限的时间内，我们总是非常专注并且有效率。**

We're always more focused and productive with limited time. 



**8、进入工作状态的最佳方式就是工作，从小任务开始做起，让工作运转起来。**

Work is the best way to get working. Start with short tasks to get the ball rolling. 



**9、迭代工作，期待完美收工会令人窒息：“做完事情，要胜于完美收工” 。动手做，胜过任何完美的想象。**

"Doing is better than perfect. "  Work iteratively. Expectations to do things perfectly are stifling.  



**10、工作时间越长，并不等于效率越高。**

More work hours doesn't mean more productivity. Use constraints as opportunities.  



**11、按重要性工作，提高效率。**

"Separate thinking and execution to execute faster and think better." Separate brainless and strategic tasks to become more productive. 



**12、有会议就尽早安排，用于准备会议的时间往往都浪费掉了。**

Organize meetings early during the day. Time leading up to an event is often wasted. 



**13、把会议和沟通 (邮件或电话) 结合，创造不间断工作时间：一个小会，也会毁了一个下午，因为它会把下午撕成两个较小的时间段，以至于啥也干不成。**

PS：当看到一个程序员冥思苦想时，不要过去打扰，甚至一句问候都是多余的。

" A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.  " Group meetings and communication (email or phone) to create blocks of uninterupted work. 



**14、一整天保持相同的工作环境。在项目/客户之间切换，会效率低。**

Keep the same context throughout the day. Switching between projects/clients is unproductive. 



**15、工作—放松—工作=高效(番茄工作法)**

> 番茄工作法是弗朗西斯科·西里洛于1992年创立的一种相对于GTD更微观的时间管理方法。使用番茄工作法，选择一个待完成的任务，将番茄时间设为25分钟，专注工作，中途不允许做任何与该任务无关的事，直到番茄时钟响起，然后在纸上画一个X短暂休息一下（5分钟就行），每4个番茄时段多休息一会儿。

Work around procrastination. Procrastinate between intense sprints of work (Pomodoro).  



**16、把不切实际的任务分割成合理的小任务，只要每天都完成小任务，你就会越来越接近那个大目标了。**

Break the unreasonable down into little reasonable chunks. A big goal is only achieved when every little thing that you do everyday, gets you closer to that goal. 



**17、从来没有两个任务会有相同的优先级，总会有个更重要，仔细考虑待办事情列表。**

==No two tasks ever hold the same importance. Always prioritize.== Be really careful with to-do lists... 



**18、必须清楚白天必须完成的那件事，是什么。 只去做那件有着最大影响的事情。**

==Only ever work on the thing that will have the biggest impact.==  



**19、把任务按时间分段，就能感觉它快被搞定了。**

Break tasks into hour increments. Long tasks are hard to get into, feels like it all needs to get done. 



**20、授权并擅用他人的力量。—君子善假于物(人)也，如果某件事其他人也可以做到八成，那就给他做！19、把任务按时间分段，就能感觉它快被搞定了。**

==“If something can be done 80% as well by someone else, delegate! ”== Delegate and learn to make use of other people. "

**21、把昨天翻过去，只考虑今天和明天。昨天的全垒打赢不了今天的比赛。—好汉不提当年勇。**

"Yesterday's home runs don't win today's games." Turn the page on yesterday. Only ever think about today and tomorrow.



**22、给所有事情都设定一个期限。不要让工作无期限地进行下去。**

==Set deadlines for everything. Don't let tasks go on indefinitely.==



**23、针对时间紧或有压力的任务，设置结束时间，万事皆可终结**

Set end dates for intense or stressful activities. Everything ends at some point. 



**24、多记，多做笔记**

"Get a reminder app for everything. Do not trust your own brain for your memory." Always take notes. 



**25、进入高效状态后，记下任何分散你注意力的东西比如Google搜索词、灵光乍现的想法、新点子等等。如果你把它们记下来，它就不会再蹦来蹦去了。**

"Write down anything that distracts you - google searches, random thoughts, new ideas, whatever. The point is, if you write them down, they'll stop bubbling up when you're in the zone."  



**26、休息，休息一下～**

Take breaks, sometimes.

Regardless of how you feel about Mark Zuckerberg, there is no denying that at the age of 32, he has figured out how to be one of the most impactful entrepreneurs on the planet, and the world is curious to see what he does in the next 32 years. Maybe there are hints in these inspiring quotes he provided so far.

**3.** "There are people who are really good managers, people who can manage a big organization, and then ==there are people who are very analytic or focused on strategy==. Those two types don't usually tend to be in the same person. I would put myself much more in the latter camp."

**5.** "Move fast and break things. ==Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.=="

**6.** "==The biggest risk is not taking any risk...== In a world that is changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks."

**12.** "==Building a mission and building a business go hand in hand==. The primary thing that excites me is the mission. But we have always had a healthy understanding that we need to do both."

**13.** "==In terms of doing work and in terms of learning and evolving as a person, you just grow more when you get more people's perspectives...== I really try and live the mission of the company and... keep everything else in my life extremely simple."

**16**. "People don't care about what someone says about you in a movie - or even what you say, right? ==They care about what you build.== And if you can make something that makes people's life better, then that's something that's really good."

**24.** =="Once you have a product that you are happy with, you need to centralize things to continue growth. "==

**26.** "Really, ==who you are is defined by the people who you know - not even the people that you know, but the people you spend time with and the people that you love and the people that you work with.== I guess we show your friends in your profile, but that's kind of different from the information you put in your profile."
