- 365 categories
- 600k images
- 10 million bounding boxes

### Detection In the Wild Challenge Workshop 2019

The competitions platform is provided by . The entrances of registration and submission are about to open. Wait a moment.

The [Objects365](https://www.objects365.org/) is a brand new dataset, designed to spur object detection research with a focus on diverse objects in the Wild. Objects365 has 365 object classes annotated on 638K images, totally with more than 10 million bounding boxes in the training set. Thus the annotations cover common objects occurring in all kinds of scene categories. Challenge for Objects365 is proposed to have two tracks:

- **Full Track.** The goal of Full Track is to explore the upper-bound performance of object detection systems, given all the 365 classes and 600K+ training images. 30K images are used for validation and another 100K images are used for testing. To evaluate the performance of object detection, the evaluation criteria for COCO (IOU from 0.5 to 0.95) benchmark will be adopted.
- **Tiny Track.** Tiny Track is to lower the entry threshold, accelerate the algorithm iteration speed, and study the long tail category detection problem.From the Objects365 dataset, 65 categories are selected, and contestants can training model using 10K training data.

#### CrowdHuman Challenge Track

The [CrowdHuman](http://www.crowdhuman.org/) dataset is large, rich-annotated and contains high diversity. It contains 15000, 4370 and 5000 images for training, validation, and testing, respectively. There are a total of 340K human instances and 22.6 persons per image from the train set, with various kinds of occlusions in the dataset. Each human instance is annotated with a head bounding-box, human visible-region bounding-box and human full-body bounding-box. We believe this dataset will serve as a solid baseline and help promote future research in human detection tasks, especially in the crowded environment.
