#### Biography

**教育**

Michael J. Black received his B.Sc. from the University of British Columbia (1985), his M.S. from Stanford (1989), and his Ph.D. in computer science from Yale University (1992). After research at NASA Ames and post-doctoral research at the University of Toronto, he joined the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 1993 where he later managed the Image Understanding Area and founded the Digital Video Analysis group. From 2000 to 2010 he was on the faculty of Brown University in the Department of Computer Science (Assoc. Prof. 2000-2004, Prof. 2004-2010). He is a founding director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany, where he leads the Perceiving Systems department.  He is also a Distinguished Amazon Scholar (VP), an Honorarprofessor at the University of Tuebingen, and Adjunct Professor at Brown University.

**获奖**

Black is a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He is a recipient of the 2010 Koenderink Prize for Fundamental Contributions in Computer Vision and the 2013 Helmholtz Prize for work that has stood the test of time. His work has won several paper awards including the IEEE Computer Society Outstanding Paper Award (CVPR'91). His work received Honorable Mention for the Marr Prize in 1999 and 2005. His early work on optical flow has been widely used in Hollywood films including for the Academy-Award-winning effects in “What Dreams May Come” and “The Matrix Reloaded.” He has contributed to several influential datasets including the [Middlebury Flow dataset](http://vision.middlebury.edu/flow/), [HumanEva](http://humaneva.is.tue.mpg.de/), and the [Sintel dataset](http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/). Black has coauthored over 200 peer-reviewed scientific publications.

**公司**

He is also active in commercializing scientific results, is an inventor on 10 issued patents, and has advised multiple startups. He uniquely combines computer vision, graphics, and machine learning to solve problems in the clothing industry. In 2013, he co-founded Body Labs Inc., which used computer vision, machine learning, and graphics technology licensed from his lab to commercialize "the body as a digital platform."  Body Labs was acquired by Amazon in 2017.

**研究兴趣**

Black's research interests in machine vision include ==optical flow estimation==, ==3D shape models==, ==human shape and motion analysis==, ==robust statistical methods==, and ==probabilistic models== of the visual world. In computational neuroscience his work focuses on probabilistic models of the neural code and applications of neural decoding in neural prosthetics.
